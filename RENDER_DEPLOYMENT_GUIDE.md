## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Build Failed"
**Solution**:
1. Check build logs in Render dashboard
2. Verify `requirements.txt` is correct
3. Make sure all files were pushed to GitHub
4. Try manual redeploy: Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"

### Issue: "Application Failed to Start"
**Solution**:
1. Check logs: Click "Logs" tab in Render dashboard
2. Verify `Procfile` exists and is correct
3. Check that `main.py` has no syntax errors

### Issue: WebSocket Connection Failed
**Solution**:
- This is normal on first load after sleep
- Refresh the page
- WebSocket will connect on second try
- In production, consider upgrading to paid tier to avoid sleep

### Issue: App is Slow / Takes Long to Load
**Solution**:
- Free tier sleeps after 15 min inactivity
- First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds
- Subsequent requests are fast
- For always-on service, upgrade to paid tier ($7/month)

### Issue: Camera/Microphone Not Working
**Solution**:
- Render uses HTTPS automatically (required for WebRTC)
- Make sure you're using `https://` not `http://`
- Allow permissions when browser prompts
- Try different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)

### Issue: Can't See Other Participants
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify both users are in same meeting ID
3. Check WebSocket connection in Network tab
4. Try refreshing both windows
